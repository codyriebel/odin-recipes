        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>In only 40 minutes you can make your choice of a classic, creamy cheesecake or a rich, dense cheesecake using your Instant Pot! All you need are the usual ingredients, your pressure cooker/Instant Pot, and a bit of time and care.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                <li>10 graham crackers finely ground</li>
                <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter melted</li>
                <li>sea salt</li>
                <li>2 tsp - 1½ tbsp brown sugar (per desired sweetness)</li>
                <li>¼ cup flour (Optional for blind-baking crust)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Batter</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>16 ounces cream cheese</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
                <li>2 tbsp cornstarch</li>
                <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 pinches sea salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place 16 ounces (454g) cream cheese, 2 large eggs, ½ cup (120g) sour cream on counter-top to reach room temperature. Then, melt the 3 - 4 tablespoons (42g - 56g) unsalted butter.*Pro Tip: this is critical for your cheesecake's success, so please make sure all the above ingredients are at room temperature before you start. If not, you may end up with lumpy fluff top cheesecake. So don't skip this step!

                    Ground Graham Crackers: Finely ground 120g graham crackers in a food processor. Or place the graham crackers in a Ziploc bag and roll them with a rolling pin.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix Crust Mixture: In a small mixing bowl, mix finely ground graham crackers, a pinch of sea salt, 2 tsp - 1 1/2 tbsp (8.3g - 19g) brown sugar together with a fork.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Perfectionist’s Step - Add Flour (if blind-baking for firmer & crisper crust): mix in ¼ cup (32g) all-purpose flour.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add Melted Unsalted Butter: Mix in roughly 3 - 4 tbsp (42g - 56g) unsalted butter until the mixture sticks together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Line Pan: Line the side & bottom of cheesecake pan with parchment paper.
                    *Note: We did not use any butter to line the parchment paper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Form Crust: Pour in the graham cracker crumbs mixture. Gently press down the crumbs with a ramekin or Mason jar to form an even layer. You can also use a spoon for the edges.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Firm Crust
                    Method #1 - Freeze: Place cheesecake pan in freezer while you make the cheesecake batter.
                    Method #2 - Blind-Bake (for firmer & crisper crust): Place crust in a 325°F oven for 15 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix Sugar Mixture: Mix 2 tbsp (16g) cornstarch, 2 pinches of sea salt, and 2/3 cup (133g) white sugar together in a small mixing bowl.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Briefly Beat Cream Cheese: In a medium mixing bowl, briefly break up the 454g cream cheese by beating it for 10 seconds with a hand mixer using low speed
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix in Sugar Mixture: Add in half the sugar mixture and beat until just incorporated using low speed (roughly 20 - 30 seconds). Scrape down the sides and hand mixer with a silicone spatula every time a new ingredient is added. Add remaining sugar mixture and beat until just incorporated using low speed (roughly 20 - 30 seconds).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add Sour Cream & Vanilla Extract: Add 1/2 cup (120g) sour cream and 2 tsp (10 ml) vanilla extract to the cream cheese mixture. Beat until just incorporated using low speed (20 - 30 seconds).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Blend in Eggs: Blend in the two eggs using low speed, one at a time.
                    Mix until just incorporated (about 15 – 20 seconds with a hand mixer & less time if you are using a powerful stand mixer). Try not to overmix on this step.
                    Scrape down the sides and hand mixer with a silicone spatula and fold a few times to make sure everything is fully incorporated.
